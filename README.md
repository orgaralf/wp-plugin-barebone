Simple Wordpress plugin to demonstrate how to create a skeleton of a 
project with GPT-Pilot  - shown here in German: 

https://www.metadist.de/gpt-pilot-ein-ki-junior-developer-fuer-vs-code/

It is a very simple plugin for Wordpress, that also gives a hint, how to
develop a plugin for Wordpress.

## What it does
It adds a Pi sign to your wordpress pages and shows a pop-up, when clicked.

## Purpose
Testing https://github.com/Pythagora-io/gpt-pilot for VS Code and it worked well.

## Usage
This plugin is free to use, copy, modify, distribute, etc. as you see fit.
A reference to me is always appreciated.
